<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Fusion Stimulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal fusion stimulator market can be categorized into implantable and non-implantable types. Implantable spinal fusion stimulators are surgically implanted devices that deliver electrical stimulation directly to the spine to promote fusion, whereas non-implantable stimulators are external devices that can be worn on the outside of the body to provide the same benefits. Both types of stimulators are used to aid in the fusion of spinal vertebrae and promote healing after spinal surgery.</p></p>
