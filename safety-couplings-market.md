<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Safety Couplings for Indirect Drives</li><li>Safety Couplings for Direct Drives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety couplings for indirect drives are used in applications where there is a disconnect between the driving and driven components, such as in belt or chain drives. These couplings prevent damage by slipping when overloaded. On the other hand, safety couplings for direct drives are used in applications where the driving and driven components are directly connected, such as in gear transmissions. These couplings protect against overloading by slipping or disengaging to prevent damage to the machinery.</p></p>
