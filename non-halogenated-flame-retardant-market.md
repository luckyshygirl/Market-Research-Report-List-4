<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Halogenated Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorous</li><li>Nitrogenous</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-halogenated flame retardants can be categorized into three main types: Phosphorous, Nitrogenous, and Other. Phosphorous-based flame retardants work by releasing water vapor to dilute flammable gases and inhibit combustion. Nitrogenous flame retardants release nitrogen oxides when exposed to high temperatures, which suppresses combustion. Other types of non-halogenated flame retardants include mineral-based compounds and intumescent systems that form a protective layer on the material surface when exposed to heat. Each type offers unique benefits and applications in the flame retardant market.</p></p>
