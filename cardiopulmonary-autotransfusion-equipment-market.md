<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiopulmonary autotransfusion equipment refers to devices used to collect and reinfuse a patient's own blood during surgery. There are two main types of autotransfusion equipment: unwashed ATS and washed ATS. </p><p>Unwashed ATS involves collecting blood from the surgical field and directly reinfusing it back into the patient without any additional processing. In comparison, washed ATS involves cleaning the collected blood to remove any contaminants before reinfusing it back into the patient, reducing the risk of infection or adverse reactions. Both types of equipment serve the purpose of reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusions during surgeries.</p></p>
