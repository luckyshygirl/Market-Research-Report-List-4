<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleeve Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Sleeve Bearing</li><li>Axial Sleeve Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sleeve bearings, also known as journal bearings, come in two main types based on their direction of load resistance: radial and axial. Radial sleeve bearings are designed to support radial loads, meaning they resist forces perpendicular to the shaft's axis. Axial sleeve bearings, on the other hand, support axial loads, resisting forces parallel to the shaft's axis. Both types are widely used in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, and machinery for their simple design and ability to reduce friction and wear.</p></p>
