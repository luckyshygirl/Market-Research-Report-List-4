<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Hemostasis Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical Detection</li><li>Mechanical Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary hemostasis analyzers are devices used to measure the blood's ability to clot. There are two main types of detection methods used in these analyzers: optical detection and mechanical detection. Optical detection analyzes the light absorption or scattering properties of the blood sample to determine clotting time, while mechanical detection measures changes in the viscosity or impedance of the sample. Both types of detection methods are important in assessing coagulation disorders and monitoring patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy.</p></p>
