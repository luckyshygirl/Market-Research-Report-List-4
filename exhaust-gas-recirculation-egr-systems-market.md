<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tube EGR Coolers</li><li>Finned EGR Coolers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems market consists of two main types of EGR coolers: Tube EGR Coolers and Finned EGR Coolers. Tube EGR coolers are designed with a series of tubes that carry exhaust gases through a coolant-filled chamber to reduce their temperature before recirculation. On the other hand, Finned EGR coolers have fins that increase the surface area for better heat transfer and are more efficient in cooling exhaust gases. Both types play a crucial role in reducing emissions and improving the efficiency of internal combustion engines.</p></p>
