<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Permeability Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Head Soil Permeability Apparatus</li><li>Falling Head Soil Permeability Apparatus</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil Permeability Apparatus is used to measure the rate at which water flows through soil samples. There are two main types of Soil Permeability Apparatus on the market: Constant Head and Falling Head. Constant Head apparatus maintains a constant water level throughout the experiment, making it suitable for coarse-grained soils. Falling Head apparatus measures the time it takes for water to flow through a soil sample under decreasing water levels, making it ideal for fine-grained soils. Both types are essential tools for studying soil permeability.</p></p>
