<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arterial Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Expansion</li><li>Balloon Dilatation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arterial vascular stents are medical devices used to treat blockages in the arteries. There are two main types of arterial vascular stents: self-expansion stents and balloon dilatation stents. </p><p>Self-expansion stents are designed to expand on their own once placed in the artery, providing support and preventing the artery from collapsing. </p><p>Balloon dilatation stents, on the other hand, are inserted into the artery and inflated using a balloon to widen the artery and improve blood flow.</p><p>Both types of stents are important tools in the treatment of arterial blockages.</p></p>
