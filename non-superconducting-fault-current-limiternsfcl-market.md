<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-superconducting Fault Current Limiter(NSFCL) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saturable core</li><li>Solid State</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-superconducting Fault Current Limiters (NSFCL) are devices used to limit excessive electricity flow during a fault in a power system. There are two main types of NSFCLs - Saturable core and Solid State. Saturable core NSFCLs utilize a magnetic core that saturates when current exceeds a certain threshold, limiting the fault current. Solid State NSFCLs, on the other hand, use semiconductor devices to control the current flow. Both types of NSFCLs are effective in improving the stability and reliability of power systems.</p></p>
