<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Semi Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disposable breathing circuits can be categorized into three types based on the design of the circuit: open breathing circuits, semi-open breathing circuits, and closed breathing circuits. Open breathing circuits allow for unrestricted flow of gases in and out of the circuit. Semi-open breathing circuits have a partial rebreathing mechanism, allowing for the recycling of some exhaled gases. Closed breathing circuits are fully rebreathing systems, recycling most of the exhaled gases. Each type of breathing circuit offers different levels of gas exchange and control in clinical settings.</p></p>
