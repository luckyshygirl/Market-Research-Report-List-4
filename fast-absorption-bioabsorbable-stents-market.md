<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fast- absorption Bioabsorbable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-based Stents</li><li>Metallic Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fast-absorption bioabsorbable stents are a type of medical device used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. There are two main types of bioabsorbable stents - polymer-based stents and metallic stents. Polymer-based stents are made from biodegradable polymers that dissolve over time, while metallic stents are made from materials like magnesium that are absorbed by the body. Both types of stents are designed to be absorbed by the body after performing their function of keeping the arteries open, reducing the risk of long-term complications compared to traditional stents.</p></p>
