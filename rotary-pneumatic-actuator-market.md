<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Pneumatic Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting Pneumatic Actuator</li><li>Single Acting Pneumatic Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary pneumatic actuators are classified into two main types: Double Acting Pneumatic Actuators and Single Acting Pneumatic Actuators. Double Acting Pneumatic Actuators use air pressure to open and close the valve in both directions, providing more control over the movement. On the other hand, Single Acting Pneumatic Actuators use air pressure to open the valve, relying on a spring to close it. Both types of actuators are commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, and automotive for controlling valve movements.</p></p>
